# Data Warehouse

A data warehouse is a specialized type of relational database, which is optimized for  
analysis and reporting of large amounts of data. It can be used to combine  
transactional data from disparate sources (such as user behavior in a web application,  
data from your finance and billing system, or customer relationship management or  
CRM) to make them available for analysis and decision-making
